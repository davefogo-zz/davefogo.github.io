I have been away from my blog because I was using all my available time to catch up in Bloc. I finished the foundations track of my Bloc course and will begin the projects phase today. I will develop blocipedia (a wiki app) first and then will probably tackle the Alexa project. Its required to complete 2 projects before the rails track is completed. However, I would like to build at least 2 more projects to gain experience and learn new things. I have particular interest in the Kele api project (building a Ruby gem to access Blocâ€™s API) and the Blocmetrics ( an API used to track user engagement with web apps). I will keep updating the blog as I progress through the projects. There will definitely be lots to write about.

Take a look at my original blog in [medium](https://medium.com/the-journey-learning-to-code-one-day-at-a-time/getting-back-to-the-blog-b2922ee85dab#.f4kl1p6il)
