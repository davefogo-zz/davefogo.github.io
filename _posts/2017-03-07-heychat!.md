Right now I am working on an angular app called HeyChat! Its a simple web based interfaced backed by firebase. It has the ability to allow the creation of multiple rooms in which chats with friends can take place. Right now I am probably 80% through the completion. I like that it updates the messages sent in real time. The beauty of two-way data binding.

While doing this I skipped using bootstrap and got a chance to practice css. It was a great experience to get a Single Page Applicationâ€™s frontend completed manually. Next time I will definitely use a frontend web-framework, but it was worth the practice.
