So the transition from JS to Ruby hasn’t been hard at all. I thought it would be harder but now I feel that I can go back and forth between languages with ease. It’s useful to remember the the curly braces are replaced by ‘def’ in ruby and the rest is easy. 

For now I don’t think I have a favorite language but this might change after I’m done with this ruby project. I am polishing current features and refactoring some code in my  Blocmarks application (This rails application allows me to save and organize bookmarks in a web based app)
