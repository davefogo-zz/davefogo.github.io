So today early in the morning about at 3 am my three skills were certified by Amazon and made live. I am excited to try them out once I get my Amazon Echo. I am not sure why all the communication that revolved around the certification of my skills came at those odd hours. I think its because the area of testing for the certification process takes place in Asia somewhere. Who knowsâ€¦ I am just very happy they got approved!
