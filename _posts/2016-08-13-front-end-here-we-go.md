The day before yesterday I officially finished the Ruby on Rails track. What a great ride!

I am getting prepared to do the pre-work for this section of the course. It consists of a few codeacademy.com courses. Each of those courses will give me the foundation for a section in the course. I am feeling pretty excited to try out Javascript. For now I have to reach out to the codeacademy folks to merge my two accounts into a single one.
