Now that I have been accepted and have chosen a bootcamp to attend I will take a break from programming to start preparing my family’s move from Bogota, Colombia to Austin, Texas USA. I still need to find a place to live (hopefully close to Hack Reactor) and some wheels. Austin has a transit system but it’s a car city so we definitely will need one. Its a huge jump and I’m excited like no other to begin this new phase of my life.There will be hard times but also good times for sure. Lone Star State here we come
