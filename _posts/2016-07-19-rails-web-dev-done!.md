After working non-stop for the past weeks I have completed the Rails web development section of the SET(software engineering track) at Bloc. I went from being behind in schedule 65% to being ahead 9%. It feels great I have to say.
I am now using the remaining time left to complete bloc marks.Its an app that is going to help me organize the hundreds of bookmarks I have stashed in safari. Iâ€™m going to organize bookmarks by topic. This will allow me to find what I need in a short time.
