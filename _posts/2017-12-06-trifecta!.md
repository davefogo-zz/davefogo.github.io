App Academy check! I got in after completing their technical and non-technical interview. It was tough to get through their admissions process but also gratifying. I am ready to start preparing for my April cohort. They have a lengthy prep-work to get done before attending. I will definitely spend quite large amount of time preparing. App Academy here we go.
