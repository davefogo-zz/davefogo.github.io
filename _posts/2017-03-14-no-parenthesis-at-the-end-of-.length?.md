I realized that all this time I had been using a Javascript property:

```
array.length
```

and not realising it didnâ€™t have the parenthesis at the end. So I went out and found this [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9041723/why-no-after-length-in-javascript) answer to my question. It is so that length is a property and not a function. This property is available to strings and arrays. Its something we use everyday and often take for granted.
