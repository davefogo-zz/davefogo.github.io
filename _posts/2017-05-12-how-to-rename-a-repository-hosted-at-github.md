I wanted to change the name of one of my apps and thought it was going to be difficult. It’s not that hard. I stumbled upon a blog [post](http://zanshin.net/2012/04/03/renaming-github-repository/) by @Mark H. Nichols and where he explains how to do it step by step.

Briefly this is what I did:

1. Logged into my Github account.
2. Opened the repo I wanted to rename.
3. Clicked on settings.
4. Changed the name in the text field that stands right below “Repository name” and voila!
