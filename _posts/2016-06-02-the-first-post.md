I started trying programming a little more than 2 years ago. Per github my first commit was on may 7th, 2014. About 2 weeks after my wedding and four years after I obtained my Bachelors of Science in Business Administration @ Boston University. Although I went to school for Finance I’ve always loved anything related to computers. I became interested in programming when I stumbled by this particular youtube video.

After this I knew I had go try it out. Right after I finished watching the video I signed up at code.org and completed the courses available at that time. Awesome way to get people interested in programming.

That’s why I signed up @ +Treehouse for their ruby on rails program. Had a great learning experience while there. I even got a tweet like from their founder once.
