How hard is it to display a filtered Firebase array in a website using ng-repeat? For me it has been tough. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. A regular un-filtered array displays just fine. The conundrum starts when I use the `.equalTo() ` Firebase function in the ordered by child Firebase array. I get the array to log to the console and it seems like the problem is in between the handing of from the service to the controller.

So far learning to use Firebase with Angular has been a lot of fun. Firebase makes data handling a charm! (no surprise Google bought them). The UI of Firebase has been “googlified” to perfection. Its nice how the JSON objects are displayed in the database dashboard. I feel like I’ll be using Firebase a lot from now on.

Anyways it’s nice to start blogging again.
