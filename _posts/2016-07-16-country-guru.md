title: Alexa project complete!
---
I did not expect this project to go that quick! I made a service that gives you Warren Buffett quotes. I added at least 100 quotes that the Oracle of Omaha has said. I will try to find more quotes as they become available.
During this project I had the opportunity to get my feet wet with the installation of node.js. Before I started this project the only programming language I knew was ruby. This was a great way to taste Javascript.
The final step in this project was to implement google analytics in each of the serviceâ€™s intents using universal analytics, a neat node.js package. I found this very useful resource created by Amazon and based on a Bloc alum. Pretty awesome!
Definitely love developing for Alexa. I will get into more advanced custom skill as time allows.
