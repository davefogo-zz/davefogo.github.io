Itâ€™s decided, I will apply and get into the best in-person coding bootcamps. Now, its just a matter of picking where to go, apply and get in. Of course attending these bootcamps is not possible until I quit my job and move to the city that hosts that particular bootcamp.I will start preparing for their application in my free time. 

Since I want to get into the top bootcamps I know the preparation for admission will be hard, but not impossible. I will do my best to make this challenge fun.
